<h4><i>Your One-Stop-Shop for all of your decorating needs</i></h4>
<br>
This Mod adds everything from parts to plants (with a total of over 600+ new items!) to the Build Menu. This allows for full freedom when decorating your factory. All Items are static meaning they are not interactive, and do not give off any radiation. Most part props require their base part and foliage items require leaves and wood.<br><br>
All three Milestones can be unlocked in HUB Tier 1 and add new Categories to the Build Menu: "Factory Props", "Foliage", and "Factory Decor".
They are where you can find all of the buildables added with this mod. Most of the items will be in the same state and size as if the part was dropped. Trees, plants, and decor items will be different sizes than the ones in the level. 
All items are subcategorized within the Factory Props Main Category and have their own Quick-Switch groups making it easy to decorate with lots of different objects. The same is true with Foliage and Decor. This mod is in active development which mean that new content is always being added.
