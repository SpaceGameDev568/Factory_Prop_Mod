 ##### __*Your One-Stop-Shop for all your decorating needs!*__

##### Multiplayer Compatible
This Mod adds everything from parts to plants (with a total of over 500+ new items!!) to the Build Menu. This allows for full freedom when decorating your factory.
All Items are static meaning they are not interactive, and do not give off any radiation.
Most part props require their base part and foliage items require leaves and wood.

Both Milestones can be unlocked in HUB Tier 1 and add new Categories to the Build Menu: "Factory Props", "Foliage", and "Factory Decor".
They are where you can find all of the buildables added with this mod. Most of the items will be in the same state and size as if the part was dropped. Trees, plants, and decor items will be different sizes than the ones in the level. 
All items are subcategorized within the Factory Props Main Category and have their own Quick-Switch groups making it easy to decorate with lots of different objects. The same is true with Foliage and Decor.
Another advantage this mod provides when decorating is that none of the items have a UI when you hover the reticle over them.
There are a few Easter Eggs in the mod; pay close attention to the item descriptions :D. If you want to know more about what's coming in the future [Visit the Trello board](https://trello.com/b/uY3LaJ8t/factory-prop-mod).

I hope this mod helps anyone wishing to make decorating their factories easier. If I have missed an item or you have encountered a bug please open an issue ticket on the GitHub page or ping me on the Modding Discord @SpaceGameDev568 (Factory Props)
