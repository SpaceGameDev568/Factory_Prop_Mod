Cliff materials to do:

Lynock's ideas:

Grass ✓
Forest ✓
Sand ✓
Desert ✕ (you already use specific parts of these, with red sandstone. Might be able to map those on the existing cliff pieces, too? They do use huge chunks of rock)
Rock ✓ (the default used on the sides of the cliffs, but then mapped for the entire cliff)    <CLIFFNAME>_INST default
Red Grass ✓
Mud? ✕ From the swamps?

Perhaps full rock textures for the rib/pillar pieces? They currently use a grass one, as well (mapped directly on top). ✓

Desert Arches later?
