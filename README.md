# Factory Props<br><br>![](https://i.imgur.com/KNzxXda.png)
This is the source code of the Factory Props mod for Satisfactory, a game by Coffee Stain Studios. The source code here is free to use for your own projects, though a portion of the code has not been made available due to it containing copyrighted assets from the game. I'd also prefer that you don't just redistribute the mod.

This is also the place to report bugs. You can view all past and ongoing issues [here](https://github.com/SpaceGameDev568/Factory_Prop_Mod/issues).

Jetbrains has provided me a free copy of their software for developing my mods, so huge thanks to them! You can check out their software here: https://www.jetbrains.com, or get a free copy for your open-source projects here: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource
